# MDP REPRESENTATION
### Reg No.: 212221240035
## AIM:
To represent a Markov Decision Process(MDP) problem in the following ways.

1. Text representation
2. Graphical representation
3. Python - Dictonary representation

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

### Problem Description
To develop an environment consisting of a mobile tower as the start and the house as the goal. The aim is to make sure the network signals reaches the house.

### State Space
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

### Sample State
4

### Action Space
* {0} Moving Up
* {1} Moving Right
* {2} Moving Down
* {3} Moving Left

### Sample Action
{1} Moving Right

### Reward Function
* +1 - If the goal is reached
* 0 - Otherwise
